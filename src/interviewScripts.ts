  /* Reverse-interview closing turn — "do you have any questions for me?"
     In Indian behavioural loops, the closing reverse-interview is heavily
     weighted: wrong questions (salary in round 1, WFH aggressively,
     leave policy pre-offer) are instant rejection triggers, while a
     substantive question ("what does success look like in 90 days?",
     "how is the team structured?") can save a borderline session.
     Inserted as a question-type step so the engine captures the
     candidate's reply for downstream scoring by
     summarizeReverseInterview() in evaluate-session.ts. Only added for
     interview types where the closing reverse turn is a real ritual —
     behavioural-class types. Treat unknown types as behavioural for
     gating: the question pool already falls back to the behavioral bank,
     so the closing-turn ritual should match (keeps `getScript(null)`
     and `getScript("nonexistent")` structurally identical). */
