- Interview data: transcripts of your spoken responses, AI-generated questions, evaluation scores, and feedback.
- Preferences: interview type selections, target companies, experience level, and display settings.
- Payment information: transaction IDs and plan details. Card numbers and billing details are handled entirely by Razorpay and are never stored on our servers.`,

- Personalization: Your target role, company, and experience level are used to tailor question difficulty and relevance.

- Cartesia: Text-to-speech for AI interviewer voice. Transcript text is sent for audio generation only.
- Deepgram: Speech-to-text for converting your spoken answers into text for evaluation.
- Razorpay: Payment processing for subscriptions and session packs. Razorpay handles all payment credentials directly.

None of these providers receive more data than is necessary to perform their specific function.`,
  },
  {
    title: "3a. Sub-processors and data location",
    body: `For transparency, here is the complete list of sub-processors that may receive your data, what they receive, and where they process it. Each is bound by a contractual data processing agreement and is restricted to the scope listed.

- Vercel (application hosting + edge compute) — Mumbai (bom1) + global edge. Receives: HTTP request data, IP for rate-limiting.
- Groq (primary LLM) — United States. Receives: resume text and interview transcript snippets, only for the duration of a single API request. Not retained.

- Sarvam AI (fallback speech-to-text + primary TTS) — India. Receives: audio for transcription, AI-generated text for voice synthesis.
- Cartesia (secondary TTS) — United States. Receives: AI interviewer text for voice synthesis.
- Microsoft Azure (tertiary TTS) — Central India. Receives: same as Cartesia.
- Razorpay (payments) — India. Receives: name, email, plan, amount. Handles card / UPI credentials directly — those never reach our servers.
- Resend (transactional email) — United States. Receives: your email address and the email body (e.g. payment receipt, password reset).
- Upstash (rate-limit + caching) — Mumbai region. Receives: short-lived rate-limit counters and request-hash → response cache entries. No raw transcript text.
- PostHog (product analytics) — European Union (eu.posthog.com). Receives: pseudonymous user ID, page views, feature events. We do not send raw transcript text or payment IDs (payment IDs are HMAC-hashed before send).
