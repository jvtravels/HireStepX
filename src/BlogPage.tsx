    intro: "Google receives over 3 million applications per year, with an acceptance rate under 1%. The interview process is notoriously rigorous — but predictable. Here are the most-asked questions and how to answer them like a top 1% candidate.",
    sections: [
      { heading: "1. Tell me about a time you led a project with ambiguous requirements", content: "Google loves ambiguity. They want to see structured thinking under uncertainty. Use the STAR method but emphasize the 'situation' — describe the specific ambiguity (unclear stakeholders? shifting goals? no precedent?) and how you created clarity.\n\nSample opener: \"In Q3 last year, I was asked to lead our team's migration to a new data pipeline, but the target architecture hadn't been finalized and three teams had competing requirements...\"" },
      { heading: "2. Describe a time you had to influence without authority", content: "This is the #1 most-asked behavioral question at Google. They operate with a flat hierarchy where ICs regularly need to align cross-functional teams.\n\nKey: Focus on how you built consensus, not how you were right. Mention specific techniques — data-driven proposals, 1:1 conversations, pilot programs." },
      { heading: "3. Tell me about your biggest failure and what you learned", content: "Google explicitly trains interviewers to assess 'intellectual humility.' A candidate who can't name a real failure is a red flag.\n\nFramework: Pick a genuine failure (not a humble-brag). Describe the decision, the outcome, and — critically — the specific behavioral change you made afterward. They want to hear that your failures actually changed you." },
      { heading: "4. How would you improve Google Search?", content: "Product sense questions test whether you can think at Google's scale. Don't jump to solutions — start with users.\n\nStructure: (1) Clarify the user segment, (2) Identify the top pain point with data reasoning, (3) Propose a solution, (4) Define success metrics, (5) Acknowledge tradeoffs." },
      { heading: "5. Describe a time you used data to make a decision", content: "Google is a data-driven company. They want to see that you don't just collect data — you interpret it critically and act on it.\n\nTip: Include a moment where the data was ambiguous or contradictory, and explain how you resolved it. This separates good answers from great ones." },
      { heading: "6. How do you prioritize when everything is urgent?", content: "This tests your framework thinking. Google interviewers want to see a systematic approach, not just 'I work hard.'\n\nBest approach: Name your framework (ICE scoring, RICE, effort/impact matrix), then give a specific example where you used it and the outcome." },
      { heading: "7. Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager", content: "Google values respectful dissent. The wrong answer is 'I always agree with my manager' — that's a red flag for Googleyness.\n\nStructure: Describe the disagreement, how you raised it constructively, the resolution, and what you learned about effective disagreement." },
      { heading: "8. Design a system to serve 1 billion users", content: "System design questions at Google assess scalability thinking. Start with requirements, estimate the scale, then work through the architecture layer by layer.\n\nTip: Always discuss tradeoffs explicitly. Google engineers make tradeoff decisions daily — they want to see you do the same." },
      { heading: "9. What makes you want to work at Google?", content: "This seems simple but is heavily weighted. Generic answers ('I love the culture') will hurt you.\n\nWinning approach: Reference a specific Google product, paper, or initiative. Connect it to your personal experience. Show you've done homework that goes beyond the careers page." },
      { heading: "10. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?", content: "Google wants people who think about impact at scale. Don't say 'managing a team' — say what problem you want to solve and how Google's resources uniquely enable it.\n\nBest answers connect personal growth with company mission. Show you've thought about how your trajectory aligns with Google's direction." },

    faqs: [
      { question: "How many rounds are in a Google interview?", answer: "Google typically has 5-6 rounds: phone screen, 2 coding interviews, 1 system design, 1 behavioral (Googleyness & Leadership), and sometimes a team-matching call." },

This establishes where you actually are (not where you think you are). Most people are shocked by their filler word count.\n\nSession 2: Targeted Practice — Focus on the 2-3 weaknesses identified in Session 1. If your answers lack structure, practice STAR method. If you use too many filler words, practice pausing instead.\n\nSession 3: Full Simulation — Simulate the real interview as closely as possible. Different question types, time pressure, follow-ups.

STAR gives them exactly what they're looking for — specific evidence of your capabilities, not vague claims.\n\nThe most common mistake: 80% of candidates describe the situation well but rush through the action and skip the result entirely. The result is the most important part." },

Their engineers interact with clients daily — verbal clarity is non-negotiable.

      { heading: "The Product Design Framework", content: "For any 'design a feature' or 'improve a product' question:\n\n1. Clarify the goal — 'What metric are we optimizing for? Retention? Revenue? Acquisition?'\n2. Define the user — 'Who specifically are we designing for? Which segment?'\n3. State the pain point — 'What friction or gap exists today?'\n4. Propose 2–3 solutions — Range from easy to ambitious. Evaluate tradeoffs.\n5. Pick one — 'I'd prioritize [solution] because [reasoning based on impact, feasibility, risk].'\n6. Success metrics — 'I'd measure success by [specific metric] with a [timeframe] target.'\n\nDo NOT jump to solutions. Spending 3 minutes on user definition before your first solution is how great PMs answer — not a waste of time." },

Could this be a measurement issue?'\nStep 3: Segment by time — 'When exactly did it start? Was it gradual or a step-change?'\nStep 4: Segment by axis — By geography, device type, user cohort, feature area.\nStep 5: Form hypotheses — List 3 possible causes ranked by likelihood.\nStep 6: Propose investigation — 'I'd verify hypothesis 1 by...'\n\nGolden rule: Don't jump to 'we need a new feature' before ruling out external factors (app store rating drop, competitor launch, viral social media issue)." },

Features must account for COD-specific flows\n• UPI-first payments — Design for UPI as primary, cards as secondary (opposite to global products)\n• Trust and verification — New online users need more trust signals (delivery estimates, return policies) than mature markets\n\nCandidates who design 'for everyone' (implicit Western user) score lower than those who design 'for Meesho's actual user' (first-time-online rural seller on Android with 2G)." },
