/**
 * Lightweight, privacy-respecting event tracker for resume tab actions.
 *
 * We don't currently have a wired analytics destination (PostHog,
 * Amplitude, etc.) — but we DO want to capture event names + key
 * dimensions in a grep-able shape so we can:
 *   1. Validate which features are getting used in production via
 *      console / log aggregator
 *   2. Wire to a real destination later without changing call sites
 *
 * To enable a real backend, replace the implementation of `track()`
 * — call sites remain stable.
