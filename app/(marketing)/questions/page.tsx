(2) Technical interview: CS fundamentals (OOP, OS, DBMS, networking), 1–2 data structure coding problems, and a project walkthrough you can defend end-to-end. (3) HR round: explicit yes on relocation and shift flexibility, a specific 'why this company' answer citing a real initiative, and a 45–60 second 'why should we hire you' answer with one measurable proof point.

These seven companies collectively hire tens of thousands of freshers annually. For higher packages (₹6.5–25 LPA), the next tier includes Zoho, Freshworks, Razorpay, PhonePe, Flipkart, Amazon (SDE-1), and the FAANG companies for candidates from IITs and NITs.",

AI voice mock interviews force you to articulate your thinking aloud, which is exactly what a live interview tests. (2) Instant feedback: a human practice partner can't consistently score your STAR framework coverage, communication clarity, or answer completeness across 30 practice sessions. AI can.
