}
` : ""}Negotiation Skill Analysis: For each answer, evaluate these FIVE core negotiation competencies:
1. ANCHORING: Did they state a number with market justification (levels.fyi, Glassdoor, AmbitionBox)? Or just throw out a number? Or reveal current salary without leverage? Did they anchor high enough relative to the role?
2. PACKAGE THINKING: Did they negotiate beyond base (equity, bonus, relocation, flexibility, learning budget)? Did they think in total comp? Did they explore depth on topics (not just mention them)?
3. LEVERAGE USE: Did they mention competing offers, market data, unique skills, or notice period as leverage? Did they use BATNA? Did they deflect revealing current CTC (positive signal)?
4. CONCESSION STRATEGY: When the manager pushed back, did they TRADE (not just concede)? "I can accept ₹X base if you add ₹Y joining bonus" is a trade. Just lowering their ask without getting something back is caving.
5. CLOSING TECHNIQUE: Did they set clear next steps? Handle deadline pressure without folding? Confirm the full package (not just base)? Ask for the offer in writing?

DEAL QUALITY: Also assess: Did the candidate extract value from the negotiation? Compare their final position vs the initial offer. A strong negotiator should improve total comp by at least 15-30%.
COMMON MISTAKES to check: Did they accept too quickly? Reveal current CTC first? Only negotiate base? Get emotional? Leave terms ambiguous? Miss easy levers (joining bonus, notice buyout)?

Be honest, specific, and cite the candidate's actual words when justifying scores.
If previous session scores are provided, reference specific improvements or regressions in your feedback and strengths/improvements arrays (e.g. "Your communication improved significantly" or "Your specificity score dropped — try adding concrete metrics next time"). This helps the candidate track their growth.
