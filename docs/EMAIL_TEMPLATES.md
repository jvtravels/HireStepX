## Design checklist for new emails

 1. **Subject ≤ 50 chars**, no ALL CAPS, no clickbait
 2. **Preheader** set explicitly (don't let it auto-fill from body)
 3. **One primary CTA** — anything else is a text link
 4. **HTML-escape** every interpolated user value (already enforced server-side; double-check in templates)
 5. **Plain-text alternative** included (Resend auto, but verify)
 6. **Footer**: physical address + unsubscribe (lifecycle only) + "Why am I getting this?"
 7. **Test rendering**: Gmail (web/iOS), Outlook desktop, Apple Mail — Litmus or Mailtrap before merge
 8. **Dark mode**: avoid pure-white backgrounds for cards; use `#F9FAFB` so it inverts cleanly
 9. **i18n note**: copy is English-only today; ₹ amounts always; IST for times where shown
10. **Tracking**: Resend open/click tracking on lifecycle, **off** for security/transactional

## When adding a new email type

1. Extract template into `server-handlers/_email-templates.ts` if it doesn't exist; keep templates pure
2. Add row to this doc (copy, file, trigger, rate limit)
3. Add a unit test for the template in `src/__tests__/emailTemplates.test.ts` (snapshot the HTML)
4. If lifecycle/marketing: gate behind user `email_preferences` column in `profiles`
5. Log via `service_usage` (fire-and-forget) for cost/volume tracking
