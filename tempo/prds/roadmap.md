# Level Up Interviews — Product Roadmap

**Client:** HireStepX | **Timeline:** 10 Weeks | **Start:** Week of April 7, 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Level Up Interviews is a greenfield MVP web platform enabling AI-driven mock interview practice for two audiences: **B2C** (individual professionals, self-serve weekly/quarterly plans) and **B2B** (coaching firms, annual licenses with bulk client management). The product emphasizes a luxury-grade first-touch experience, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, and GDPR-compliant data controls.

---

## Current State

The repo currently contains a basic Vite + React scaffold. **The first major task is migrating to the target stack: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.**

## Phase-by-Phase Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Kickoff & Foundation (Week 1)

**Goal:** Dev environment is fully operational. Database schema exists. First design is already approved.

#### Frontend (Tempo)

- [ ] Migrate repo from Vite to **Next.js 14 App Router** with TypeScript

- [ ] Install and configure: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, react-hook-form, zod, date-fns

- [ ] Configure Vercel project + preview deployments

- [ ] Set up Stripe sandbox (test keys, product/price IDs for B2C $29/week, $199/3mo, B2B annual)

- [ ] Establish project folder structure:

  ```
  src/app/
    (public)/          — landing, login, signup, privacy, terms
    (dashboard)/       — B2C authenticated routes
    (admin)/           — B2B admin routes
    api/               — API route handlers
  src/components/
    ui/                — shadcn/ui primitives
    shared/            — shared components (nav, sidebar, modals)

    admin/             — admin-specific components
  prisma/
    schema.prisma
    seed.ts
  ```

#### Backend (Client)

- [ ] Set up Supabase project (Postgres, Storage bucket for audio)

- [ ] Define Prisma schema with all 7 entities: User, Organization, MockSession, Invite, Payment, AuditLog, DataRetentionPolicy

- [ ] Run initial migration

- [ ] Write seed script: 2 B2B orgs, 1 B2C user, 5 mock sessions with sample feedback JSON

- [ ] Configure Supabase Storage bucket with 20MB file size limit

#### Designer (Tempo)

- [ ] Landing page design already approved pre-kickoff

- [ ] Continue delivering: signup, login screens

#### Milestone M1 — Dev Starts Day 1

> Repo scaffolded, environments live, DB schema + seed data operational on Day 1.
