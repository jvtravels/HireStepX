# HireStepX — Product Requirements Document

**Product:** HireStepX (formerly Level Up Interviews / HireReady) | **Date:** June 2026 | **Status:** Live (Production) | **Version:** 3.0 (as-built, reconciled to code)

> **Maintenance note (June 2026):** This document is the single source of truth for HireStepX and is verified against the codebase. Earlier revisions (≤2.1) described a React 18 + Vite SPA, a Groq-only LLM, Google Cloud Neural2 TTS, and auto-renewing Starter/Pro subscriptions — none of which match the shipped product. Those sections have been corrected against `package.json`, `src/dashboardComponents.tsx`, the TTS/STT cascade in `server-handlers/`, and `REPORT_VERSION` in `server-handlers/evaluate-session.ts`. The living spec is re-verified at the top of every weekly review; a section that drifts from code is a defect.

---

## TL;DR

HireStepX is an AI-powered mock-interview platform aimed at Indian candidates preparing for real interviews. It targets **B2C individual candidates**. Users pick a target role/company, optionally upload a resume, then run a real-time voice mock interview with an AI interviewer that speaks (TTS) and listens (STT). After completion they receive a scored report with STAR breakdowns, a coached model answer, a five-pillar Readiness Index, and skill-decay tracking for spaced repetition — personalized against their uploaded resume. Monetized via Razorpay (INR, UPI-first) across four **non-auto-renewing** tiers: Free (₹0, 3 sessions), Per-session top-up (₹9), Weekly (₹49, 10 sessions / 7 days), and Monthly (₹149, 40 sessions / 30 days). Plans do not auto-renew; there is no annual plan.

## Background

Job interview preparation for senior professionals is underserved. Existing tools are either too generic (question banks), too informal (peer practice), or too expensive (1:1 human coaching at $200+/session). HireStepX combines AI-driven question generation, real-time conversational simulation with text-to-speech, speech recognition for candidate responses, resume-aware personalization, and role-specific scoring into a single platform.

### Market Context

- **Human coaching:** $200–400/session, requires scheduling, not on-demand
- **Generic prep tools:** Question banks (Glassdoor, LeetCode) — no personalization, no simulation
- **AI competitors:** Emerging but lack luxury positioning and role-specific depth for senior professionals

**Differentiation:** Deep India-specific domain modelling (role-competency briefs, company-tier classifier, salary bands, Indian HR/behavioral personas, and an India communication-register detector), adaptive AI that tailors questions to resume and role, a multi-provider voice stack (Sarvam Bulbul → Cartesia → Azure → Web Speech for TTS; Deepgram → Sarvam → Web Speech for STT), resume-integrated evaluation, a five-pillar Readiness Index with skill-decay tracking, Google Calendar sync, and India-first pricing via Razorpay (UPI-first, non-auto-renewing tiers + per-session top-up).

---

## Target Users

### Individual Professionals (B2C)

- **Who:** Senior professionals preparing for leadership, PM, engineering, or strategic roles. Recently laid off, transitioning, or upskilling.
- **Pain point:** No way to practice realistic, personalized interviews on-demand without scheduling a human coach.
- **Impact:** Users gain confidence, receive structured feedback on communication, structure, leadership, and problem-solving skills — calibrated against their actual resume and career trajectory.

### Security (As Implemented)

- **Authentication:** Supabase JWT-based auth on all API endpoints. Auth bypass only in local dev when Supabase unconfigured.
- **CORS:** Strict origin allowlist via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var. No wildcard fallbacks. Localhost allowed for development.
- **CSRF:** Origin header validation on all state-changing POST endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting:** Per-IP rate limiting via Upstash Redis. Separate buckets per endpoint. Warning logged when Redis not configured (no unsafe in-memory fallback).
- **IP Security:** Uses Vercel's `x-real-ip` header (not spoofable) with `x-forwarded-for` fallback.
- **Payment Security:** Dual-mode HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (order + subscription), server-side amount validation against Razorpay API, subscription status verification, duplicate payment protection (payments table + profile checks), specific error codes (`SIGNATURE_MISMATCH`, `AMOUNT_MISMATCH`, `INVALID_PLAN`, etc.), Razorpay ID format validation (regex).
- **Webhook Security:** HMAC-SHA256 webhook signature verification, 8-second global processing timeout, idempotency checks on all payment events.
- **Prompt Injection:** Multi-layer sanitization — strips role markers, LLM tokens (`<|im_start|>`), code blocks, JSON role injection, "ignore previous instructions" patterns, control characters. Input length caps per field.
- **Session Limits:** Server-side enforcement — checks subscription tier from DB on each API call (not trusting client state).
- **Headers:** CSP, X-Frame-Options (DENY), X-Content-Type-Options (nosniff), HSTS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
- **Cron Protection:** `CRON_SECRET` required (fails closed when not set).
- **Error Logging:** Sensitive data (userId, amounts) truncated in server logs. Client-side error reporter for uncaught exceptions.
- **Body Size Limits:** 1MB max on payment endpoints.

### Application Architecture

> **Note:** The tree below is from the legacy React/Vite SPA and is retained only for historical file-name reference. The live app is a Next.js App Router project: routes live under `app/`, shared page/component code under `src/` (e.g. `AuthContext.tsx`, `DashboardHome.tsx`, `Interview.tsx`, `useInterviewEngine.ts`), API handlers under `server-handlers/` exposed via thin `app/api/*/route.ts` shims, and large static data under `data/`.

## Subscription Tiers

All paid tiers are **one-time top-ups — none auto-renew.** Internal tier keys are `free | starter | pro`; the per-session ₹9 credit is a one-time order, not a tier.

| Plan (UI name) | Tier key | Price | Duration | Limits | Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | `free` | ₹0 | Forever | 3 sessions total | Basic score & feedback, email report |
| Per session | — (credit) | ₹9 | One session | +1 session credit | One-time top-up |
| Weekly | `starter` | ₹49 | 7 days (no renew) | 10 sessions / 7 days | All question types, detailed feedback & skill scores, resume analysis |
| Monthly | `pro` | ₹149 | 30 days (no renew) | 40 sessions / 30 days (`PRO_MONTHLY_LIMIT = 40`) | Full AI coaching, ideal-answer comparisons, performance analytics & trends, interview calendar, Google Calendar sync, export |

30% student discount on `.ac.in` / `.edu.in` emails; 7-day refund window; the annual plan was removed.

### Plan Lifecycle (one-time top-ups, no auto-renew)

```
Purchase (one-time order) → Verify → Activate (timed access) → Expiry → Downgrade to Free
```

- **Purchase:** One-time Razorpay order via `/api/create-order` (UPI-first). There is no recurring subscription; nothing renews automatically.
- **Verify:** Client sends payment response to `/api/verify-payment` — HMAC signature verification, server-side amount/status validation, duplicate-payment protection.
- **Access window:** Verified payment grants a timed allotment (Weekly 7 days / Monthly 30 days) with the session caps above. When the window ends, access lapses with no charge.
- **Expiry:** Cron `/api/reset-expired-subscriptions` plus client-side polling downgrades lapsed users to Free.
- **Legacy plumbing (present but not the active model):** subscription/webhook/pause/cancel handlers exist in the codebase from an earlier auto-renew design and the `cancel_at_period_end` / `subscription_paused` columns remain. They are not part of the shipped non-auto-renewing flow; treat them as deprecated until removed.

### Tier Enforcement

- **Client-side:** `subscriptionTier` in AuthContext, checked before rendering Pro-gated features (calendar, analytics)
- **Server-side:** `checkSessionLimit()` queries DB on every LLM API call — verifies tier and session count, auto-downgrades expired subscriptions
- **Auto-downgrade:** 60-second polling interval on client; server-side expiry check on every request; daily cron for stragglers

### Transactional Emails

| Trigger | Recipient | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payment verified | Buyer | Branded HTML: plan, amount, dates, payment ID, CTA |
| Subscription renewed (webhook) | Subscriber | Plan renewed, new end date, CTA |
| Subscription cancelled | Subscriber | Plan name, access-until date, reactivate link |
| Subscription paused | Subscriber | Pause confirmation, resume link |
| Subscription resumed | Subscriber | Resume confirmation, dashboard link |
| Renewal reminder (cron) | Expiring in 1–3 days | Renewal reminder with upgrade CTA |

| Auth & Context | 2 | ~30 | AuthContext, DashboardContext |
| Interview Flow | 3 | ~40 | Interview, InterviewComponents, interviewAPI |
| Payment & Subscriptions | 3 | ~35 | payment-verification, paymentFlow, subscription-expiry |
| Security | 4 | ~50 | CORS validation, input sanitization, session limits, API shared |
| Components | 4 | ~40 | SessionDetail, UpgradeModal, ErrorBoundary, accessibility |
| Utilities | 6 | ~60 | tokens, TTS, supabase, dashboardHelpers, resumeParser, extractJSON, interviewScripts |
| Integration | 2 | ~30 | e2e-flows (synthetic), accessibility |
| **Total** | **24** | **319** | Unit + integration |

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Not Built (From Original PRD)

- B2B admin dashboard, coach workflows, client management
- Multi-org / team features
- Clerk auth (replaced with Supabase Auth)
- Stripe payments (replaced with Razorpay)
- Next.js App Router (replaced with React + Vite SPA)
- Prisma ORM (replaced with Supabase client)
- shadcn/ui component library (replaced with custom inline styles)
- TanStack Table (replaced with custom list components)
- Audio file upload to object storage
- GDPR data retention policy configuration
- AuditLog for destructive actions
- Enterprise SSO, 2FA
- Demo video on landing page

### Known Issues

- **Resend emails:** Free tier `onboarding@resend.dev` sender can only deliver to the Resend account owner's email. Custom domain verification required for production emails.
- **No E2E tests:** 24 unit/integration test files (319 tests) but no Playwright/Cypress for critical flows.
- **Large components:** `Interview.tsx` and `App.tsx` are 1500+ lines — partially mitigated by `InterviewComponents.tsx` extraction.
- **Inline styles:** Tailwind is a dependency but unused; all styling is inline objects.
- `verifyAuth()` **dev bypass:** Returns `authenticated: true` when Supabase not configured — safe in production but a footgun if deployed without Supabase.

### Potential Improvements

- E2E test suite for payment, interview, and auth flows (Playwright)
- Component splitting for remaining large files
- Migrate inline styles to Tailwind utility classes
- Verified Resend domain for production email delivery
- WebSocket-based real-time interview (replace polling)
- Audio recording upload for playback review
- PDF export for session reports
- Mobile-optimized interview experience
- Two-way Google Calendar sync (currently one-way import only)
- Webhook retry/dead-letter queue for failed processing
- Admin dashboard for monitoring payments and subscriptions
